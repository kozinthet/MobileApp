    <string name="first_fragment">My favorite things in life don\’t cost any money. It\’s really
        clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.</string>
    <string name="second_fragment">I\’m as proud of many of the things we haven\’t done as the
        things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.</string>
    <string name="third_fragment">Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the
        only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to
        do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\’t found it yet, keep looking. Don\’t
        settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\’ll know when you find it.</string>
